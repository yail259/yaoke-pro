## Foreword

Growing up in the 2000s and experiencing the education in its full was a complex experience. Any kind of experience involving personal development is filled with self-fulfilling prophecies, ego, heartbreak and any state known to man. For those of us who are lucky, this stretches throughout our entire lives. 

There is nothing more important than education, and especially early education that shapes the course of a person. It is the North Star towards a regretful life of crime or a satisfied plumber, a musician travelling around the world or a lawyer trapped in his job. And yet so little attention is paid, so little credit thrown around, so few accusations, such poor care is given to education in our society. The battles, debates and tension that should be sung for generations are so tragic and trivial. 

It is no wonder we don’t care. Those of us who come out satisfied and set-up for success are too busy with our ambitions, and those who are disheartened and abandoned, lost in the process, only have the ears of each other and confused, angry testimonies. 

The modern education system is legacy. As of writing this in 2022, most countries' education systems are forks of each other, clones of an architecture conceptualised by men long dead and filled with assumptions, concepts, and values of a practically irrelevant past. And yet innovation is here. Finland is doing absolutely wonderful work and sets a benchmark for the difference in a highly functional education framework. 

I will present my own completely hypothetical educational system. In retrospect this may seem crude, but the attempt to propose a novel system is certainly important enough to warrant an attempt anyhow. I am open to criticism. Tear me apart. Create dialogue. The most important thing is that people actively engage in strategising and conceptualising improvements, which is effort better spent than coming up with new JavaScript frameworks. Dialogue and debate will set a new standard for the experience of generations and generations of people, and hopefully by the end of it, it’ll be completely hysterical that the Head of Education aren’t just people who lost to their equally unqualified colleagues in becoming the Head of Transport. 

As a final motivation for change, education will undoubtedly change all facets of our society for the better. That classmate who clearly needs more teacher attention will maybe be able to keep a few friends, that colleague who clearly needed a crash course in basic mathematics would have learnt it well in the first place, and, god forbid, managers, including politicians, will actually be trained and qualified for the role they occupy.


## Principles

There are several key principles in the ideal education system. As such, any system aims to maximise the degree to which the following are possible:


1. Self-paced learning. It’s an undisputed fact of psychology that people are born with different natural abilities and talents. Allowing individuals to develop their own interests and talents at a pace fast enough to constantly challenge them is vital to both engagement and efficiency. It’s also important for students to develop meta-skills in planning their own learning so as to be more autonomous and self-critical learners and individuals.
2. Key core knowledge. Although the courses are self-paced and self-scheduled, some fundamental knowledge up to the level of fundamental language, mathematics, science, social sciences and art are required for the students to allow them to make an informed decision in their future pathway and be holistically educated individuals.
Physical development. Physical health is critically linked to overall happiness and quality of life. Fostering an interest in fitness and sports activities and a culture of healthy progression is key to students’ long-term welfare.
3. Healthy social environment. One of the key functions of education is to prepare students to enter adult society. Allowing children to interact with each other in a regulated, natural, but guided social space is essential to children developing key social skills and abilities.
4. Parental education. There is no point in building the perfect education system if the parents are smoking copium or forcing their children to study 24/7 to become a doctor. Creating tension in the family due to parents and the school working towards two different directions is the least desirable result. This is perhaps the most challenging principle but some strategies will be outlined below.
5. High quality teaching staff. One thing in education hasn’t changed since humans first evolved to be intelligent, and that is the mentor-mentee relationship. Regardless of the construct of the system, the set-up of the classroom, the type of students, there is one common denominator that dominates the overall experience. It’s the quality of the teacher. We all have had a teacher who blew our minds and inspired and motivated us to explore knowledge on our own, and there’s always that one incompetent person who can’t get a class to quieten down and barely know the subject themselves.
6. Philosophy and ethics. Philosophy and ethics lessons are compulsory for a set amount of units and are unbiased presentations of philosophical frameworks and ideas. This is always scheduled within the same age group to allow students to form friendships easily.

## Novel System Outline

In the ideal education system, it would be set-up much like the way universities set-up their unit course systems. (Much of this will be a description of how existing universities work, with tweaks),

The adoption of a system to satisfy the above principles would be gradual, first set up as a pilot school alongside existing schools. Participation must be completely voluntary and supported by the parents, who understand the expectation placed on them to be patient and cooperative. Withdrawal is voluntary. A group of high quality teaching staff is hired based on the number of students.

Each course would be a unit, say basica algebra at the year 7 level would be algebra7001, and would stretch across a semester. There is a credit point load associated with each unit and students must satisfy a certain amount of credit points to be considered full-time participants of the school. Each unit has a prerequisite as to create unit pathways for the students to schedule their own uptaking of units. Young students will not be limited to standard school subjects such as English and Maths, but will be allowed to explore many fields traditionally exclusive to university students, such as psychology, complex engineering, programming etc. Teaching staff are encouraged to be selected from existing university students as they are practically cheaper to hire and passionate experts on the topic. Traditionally the exclusion of such subjects is due to field professionals exclusively entering the industry and this aims to alleviate this issue. 

Large units will have a lecturer to provide consistent teaching across the unit. Then classes of 20 will be taught by tutors in in-person lessons that work through examples and exercises. Personal study is highly encouraged to practice the new content.

If appropriate, high quality online material may substitute a lecturer in being the content provider if it’s as interesting, if not more, than a live alternative. 

Every unit is organised by a field professional in its content, scheduling and activities. 

Competent and engaging senior students are encouraged to become tutors for the lower level units that they have completed. This fosters a positive learning environment where students become role-models for each other and actively engage in leadership and teaching responsibilities. Peer based tutors are more engaging and relatable, and are often talented individuals who are otherwise unemployed. They are a criminally under-utilised resource in traditional schools and are highly encouraged.

After school extracurricular activities are highly encouraged and free to attend. This includes art, music, sport and STEM projects.


## Strategies for educating parents

It’s important that a mellow approach is taken to educating the parents. We are not educating them because we are better than them. It’s only because we have more experience in education and are supporting them to have a healthy familial relationship and ensuring a healthy trajectory for their children. The key of this 'education' is really conflict 
resolution and allowing the experience of the student to be smooth and enjoyable. As such, if the parents are to a large degree communicating well and happily with the student, 
no intervention is necessary.
